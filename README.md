## Managed Worker Quickstarts

This repository contains a set of templates meant to be deployed onto a Hatchet instance which illustrate workers and workflows. We've implemented a template for Python, Typescript, and Go. Each template deploys a workflow which spawns a child workflow, and each parent workflow contains a DAG.
